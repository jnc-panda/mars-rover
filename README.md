# mars-rover
A rover has landed on Mars! Once landing on a plateau with a very well defined area, the Rover can move to a point within the plateau via a string of commands. Beware, the Mars mission is on a very tight budget, so venturing outside of the plateau is not advised!

## Running the Rover
Simply open the Main class and press play!

### Creating the Plateau
The console will prompt the user for the dimensions of the plateau. There is no limit here. Enter the range of the x-axis, return, and then the y-axis range can be entered.

### Creating a Spawn Point
Once the plateau dimensions have been initialised, the user is prompted for a spawn point. Co-ordinates are given individually, and have the format of: X Y D. 
Here X and Y are the x and y coordinates respectively, whereas D is the direction which the rover is facing. This can be one of N, E, S or W.
